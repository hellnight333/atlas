"""The pipeline, start to finish.

Discovery → inspection → qualification → proposal → approval → send, with an
event recorded at every transition so the funnel in ``metrics.py`` is derived
from what happened rather than from what the current state implies.

The service holds the sequence and nothing else. Scoring lives in
``qualification``, prose in ``proposals``, the human decision in ``gate``, and
the guards in ``outreach``. Anything that starts to look like business logic in
here belongs in one of those.

Note what this deliberately does **not** do: there is no ``run_everything``
method that discovers, qualifies, writes and sends. The gap between
``prepare`` and ``send`` is where a person goes, and closing it with a
convenience method would make the safe path the longer one.
